## Overview

The task is to create a Kanban Board for managing tasks. The Kanban board is a tool for workflow visualization, designed to help you bring clarity to your work process and enhance efficiency by limiting work in progress.

### How it works

- It works just like a typical Kanban board.
- User can create different boards for different topics. Board creation is so simple because the board has separate button for this.
- To create a board, user needs to provide a name for the board, the and also the columns list.
- User can edit the board if anything needs to be changed.
- User can delete the board.
- User can create tasks under the columns list.
- To create a task, user needs to provide the title, description, subtasks list and the current status that means the column user wants to use for adding the task.
- Status change is also possible. User needs to drag the task from the current location to other location.
- User can edit the task.
- User can delete the task.

### The challenges I Faced

- This one was a challenging taks for me especially when I implemented the drag and drop feature.
- Defining type was another challenging thing for me and still I am working on providing proper types to code.
- After a while, I wrote plain CSS.
- So many states to manage, I wish I used a state manager for this.
- I used Formik before with Chakra UI but for the first time I use Formik in a personal projects. It was fun to learn.

### Built with

- TypeScript
- ReactJS
- React Beautiful DND
- Formik
- Yup
- CSS 3

### What I learned

- It was complex yet interesting project for me. I have learned a tons of new things. Among them, I have not worked with drag and drop before. It was pretty much fun to learn and apply.
- Beside that, I used Yup and Formik for form and validation. It was also interesting.

### Continued development

- So many things I have plan to work with, among them I need to define types properly.
- There are still few bugs that needs to go away.
- I will transform this to a fullstack project.
- Also, I will add user authentication.
